### About meðŸ‘‹

First of all, allow me to say hello there and welcome to my GitHub page. My name is Emmanuel Farrar and I am mobile application developer. This profile will be used as I continue learning about mobile app development and potentially some side projects once I am ready to take on such ventures. With that said expect to see a lot of tutorials and pieces of projects as I hone my skills. At a later date I will transition this to a repo of completed projects.
